# ICER_user_data_analytics

## Overview


The Institute for Cyber Enabled Research (ICER) provides critical infrastructure for computational academic research, catering to various disciplines. Our project aims to delve into how users engage with ICER's systems, assessing usage efficiency and exploring avenues for optimization. By enhancing our understanding of user behaviors and system interactions, we can guide ICER in optimizing resource allocation, potentially leading to significant cost savings.

## Project Description

Leveraging the SLURM job database and GPFS file metadata, this project focuses on developing classification systems to categorize user workloads and disk utilization patterns. Employing unsupervised learning methods, we aim to analyze extensive datasets, thereby refining resource usage statistics and creating tools for system improvement. Our objectives include grouping similar users, identifying underutilization of resources, and predicting job queue times, among others.

## Division of Labor

Our team is divided to tackle multiple research questions simultaneously, ensuring efficient project progression. The prioritization of these questions is dynamic and may evolve as the project advances. Key research areas include:

Predicting resource underutilization/overutilization by users.

Categorizing users based on system usage patterns.

Analyzing job queue times and influential factors.

Identifying outliers in data utilization.

Assessing resource subscription levels.

Evaluating resource underutilization in job executions.

Investigating user utilization patterns in relation to academic calendars.

The team will initially focus on a few questions before branching out to address others concurrently. This approach allows for adaptability and deeper insights as we familiarize ourselves with the data.
